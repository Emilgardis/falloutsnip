figment's TESsnip Fork (Fallout Edition)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

FalloutSnip is a fork of the TESVSnip which was itself a fork of the TESsnip utility bundled with Fallout Mod Manager with changes specifically for Fallout 4.

You can also view and edit the data saved in a subrecord, in either hex or string format, as well as editing record headers.

Requirements:
  .NET 3.5
